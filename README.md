Open-Source General Billing Manager

CSBill is an open-source application that allows you to manage clients and contacts and send invoices and quotes.

Requirements
------------

CSBill is built on [Symfony2][1] which is only supported on PHP 5.3.3 and up.

Be warned that PHP versions before 5.3.8 are known to be buggy and might not
work for you:

 * before PHP 5.3.4, if you get "Notice: Trying to get property of
   non-object", you've hit a known PHP bug (see
   https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=52083 and
   https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=50027);

 * before PHP 5.3.8, if you get an error involving annotations, you've hit a
   known PHP bug (see https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=55156).

*Note:* The latest version of PHP is always recommended

Installation
------------

To install the from source, you first need to clone the repository, then you need [composer][2] in order to install all the dependencies.

To clone the repository, issue the following command. Remember to clone the repository to the path you want, that is accessible from Apache.

    https://github.com/smallBiz/CSBill.git

Then go into the repository directory

    cd CSBill

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

When composer is finished downloading, you can install the optional dependencies:

    php composer.phar install
    
After all the depencies has been installed, the last step is to install all the web assets

    php app/console assets:install --symlink web
